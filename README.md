# Dotefy - lyrics search

## Description

Dotefy is a innovative lyrics search web app that helps you discover the deeper meaning of music.\
Powered by the Genius API, our platform empowers you to unravel the artist's true intentions and dive into the depths of their musical genius.

## Concept
Inspired by ‚Äúyou need to use at least 2 technologies that we haven‚Äôt used in class‚Äù, we decided to create a web app that focuses on music.\
We wanted to create something fun and beautiful looking.  \
An app that helps you rediscover your favourites songs as you sing them out loud, sounded like a great idea! üåü
